I am a physical oceanographer who is interested in numerical modelling, coastal oceanography, ocean-atmosphere interactions and climate. I completed my Ph.D. in oceanography at the University of British Columbia in 2022. For my doctoral thesis project, I explored wind-driven circulation and upwelling in the Salish Sea on the US/Canadian Pacific coast using a high-resolution numerical ocean model. I developed an interest in high-performance computing and data-oriented software development in Python over the course of this project, and I aspire to pursue these interests further as they relate to broader modelling applications of the ocean and atmosphere. I also enjoy hiking, cycling and playing music in my spare time.
